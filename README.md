## About

My first legitimate React project. A means of storing read books and what books I plan to read.

Testing my knowledge on (and learning a great deal about):

- Basic React syntax
- React forms
- API calls

I plan on using local storage to store the data, but once I get a handle on back-end programming, I plan to build that functionality in to take the load off local storage.
