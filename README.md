# MyLibrary

## About

My first "legitimate" React project. A means of storing books I've read and what books I plan to read.

Testing my knowledge on (and learning a great deal about):

- Basic React syntax
- React forms
- Conditional rendering
- API calls

I plan on using local storage to store the data, but once I get a handle on back-end programming, I plan to build that functionality in to take the load off local storage.

## To Do

- Export aspects of the BookItem component into their own independent components
- Implement a filter for read books, unread books, and all books
- API call to dynamically generate book covers
